# Life-Expectancy-Model
Creation of Linear Regression model using WHO dataset. In collaboration with Kacper Rawicki https://github.com/KacperRawicki and Ming Huan https://github.com/MingHuanGit

Instructed to construct two models: One that uses the least information necessary to make a prediction, as well as a more elaborate one that can be used if countries decide to share more sensitive data.

Target was to score a better RMSE of 4.5

Life Expectancy Predictive Model Data taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lashagoch/life-expectancy-who-updated. The code should be ran in the following order:
Group_6_Life_Expectancy_Cleaning_and_EDA.ipynb
Group_6_Life_Expectancy_Feature_Engineering.ipynb
Group_6_Life_Expectancy_Modelling
Group_6_Final_Function.ipynb

A function with only non-sensitive data is available:
